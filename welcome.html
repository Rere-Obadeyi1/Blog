        <p>When it comes to culture, you can trust Lagos is Africa's melting point, as there are over 300 ethnicities here, from the Indians at Ilupeju and the Chinese communities to the Brits and Americans on the island, coming to Lagos, you can be sure of not being left out as there would be something you definitely would be able to relate to. Walking down the streeets of Yaba and indeed the island would take you down the memory lane, as the names of former colonials masters of the late 1800s to the mid-1900s and the houses they built even with the names of native Lagosians in the area and those dispersed all across the state, tell a story of this city's interaction with the British</p>
